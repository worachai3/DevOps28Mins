FAQ

Q: Why do we need terraform.tfstate?
A: - To map the real world to the terraform world. Terraform.tfstate is the only source of truth for terraform.
   It is the only way terraform knows what is going on in the real world.
   - meta data: what is the resource id, what is the resource name, what is the resource type, what is the resource provider
   - perfomance: terraform.tfstate is used to determine what needs to be created, updated, or deleted.

Q: Why do we create many terraform projects?
A: Best practice - Group resources having similar lifecycles
   and create separate terraform projects for each group.
