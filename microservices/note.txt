## Deployment file for microservices

          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 512mi

get 100m of 1024m cpu when started pod
and 512mi of memory

          limits:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 1024mi

limit to 500m out of 1024m per pod
and 1024mi

        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
            port: liveness-port
          failureThreshold: 5
          periodSeconds: 10
          initialDelaySeconds: 60

This is to check readiness of pod by send get request to path (/), port (liveness-port) which is configed
failure can happen 5 times maximum each request will be send every 10 seconds and this probe will give 60 seconds
delay for pod to start

        ports:
        - name: liveness-port
          containerPort: 8080

Assign name liveness-port to port 8000

If this probe get success from get request then pod will be ready

        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
            port: liveness-port
          failureThreshold: 5
          periodSeconds: 10
          initialDelaySeconds: 60

This probe will check if pod need to be restarted if this probe doesn't get response for 5 times
this pod will be restarted
